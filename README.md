## Week 1 Progress
During the first week, we set up the repository and defined the project foundation.  
- Repository created with MIT license and .gitignore.  
- Scope and objectives finalized (multi-loan prioritization, predictive modeling, goal tracking).  
- Input/output parameters listed — income, expenses, loans, EMIs, and goals.  
- Mock datasets prepared simulating multiple user profiles.  
- Dashboard wireframe and AI reasoning flow defined.  

## Next Steps
Week 2 – Backend architecture setup & database schema design.

## Week 2 Progress
During the second week, the backend architecture and database schema were designed.  
The team created structured tables for users, loans, and goals, and outlined the API endpoints for future development.  
Additionally, a blueprint for the agent-based system was defined, detailing the key roles of the Data, Financial Analysis, EMI Optimization, Predictive Analytics, and Alert Agents.  
This forms the foundation for data handling and agent interaction in the upcoming weeks.
